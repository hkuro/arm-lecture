ARM programs to illustrate tutorials

This repository is forked from https://github.com/embedded2015/arm-lecture.

I modified some code to satisfy homework request as follows:

1. Implement Finonacci using ARM assembly language and must be recursive and Non-recursive version.

2. Try to optimize code using Thumb2 conditional code.

3. Try to evaluate the efficiency of the Fibonacci and compare recursive and non-recursive performance.
